Once upon a time there was a little boy who spent his life locked in rooms. He was upside down and couldn’t seem to do anything right. As he began to move through the institutions he knew he had to somehow make the best of it. He began to befriend his captors as much as possible. He would ask if he could come out and clean or work. Before he knew it he was able to move freely in the buildings. They were used to him being out now so they paid him no mind. He thought it was funny to go in other peoples room when no one was around and help himself. It was funny to him because he was able to see everyone’s secrets. He could not believe how nasty people are when they think no one is there. The jails were harder to manipulate but He found his way. He became such an expert at sneaking out and roaming around that he started doing it naked just to see if he could get away with it. The thrill he felt roaming the deserted hallways and crevices at night was exhilarating to him. Sometimes he would sneak up to the guard offices and watch them. They never saw him because he was sneaky. If they were asleep, he would sneak into their office and take a shit on the floor and run away to his shadows. Buy always watching he realized that they were just pretending to be sleeping. They actually liked what he was doing and waited till he left so they could eat his shit. They would masterbate and suck on his poop. They wanted it so bad they would ask him during the day for more.
